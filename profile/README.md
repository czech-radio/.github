# Czech Radio: Strategic Development Department

**We create software and methodology to analyze Czech Radio broadcasting.**
 
The task of the *software development section* is, in close cooperation with the *analytical section*, to design and create supporting software in the form of libraries or applications, which is used for the analysis of radio broadcasting. This involves not only creating the software, but also deploying and maintaining it so that it can be used by an analyst without the need for programmer intervention.

Our software projects can be divided into two groups. The first group are libraries, which are the basic building block of our programs. The library (SDK) is designed to perform one and clearly defined task. Another second group are applications that are built on top of these libraries.

Programs controlled from the command line are mainly used for the needs of programmers or automation. For the analytical section, we usually create applications and services with a web user interface.

Some our projects are freely available on the [organization's website](https://github.com/czech-radio/) as open-source software.
