# Czech Radio: Strategic Development Department

**We create software and methodology to analyze Czech Radio broadcasting.**
 
The task of the *software section* is, in close cooperation with the *analytical section*, to design and create supporting software in the form of libraries or applications used for radio broadcast analytics.

Some of our projects are freely available on our [GitHub](https://github.com/czech-radio/) as open-source software.
