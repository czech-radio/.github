# Czech Radio: Strategic Development Department

**We create software and methodology to analyze Czech Radio broadcasting.**
 
The task of the *software development section* is, in close cooperation with the *analytical section*, to design and create supporting software in the form of libraries or applications, mostly used for radio broadcast analytics. This involves not only creating the software but also deploying and maintaining it so that it can be used by an analyst without the need for programmer intervention. Programs controlled from the command line are mainly used for the needs of programmers or automation. We usually create applications and services with a web user interface for the analytical section.

Some of our projects are freely available on the [organization's website](https://github.com/czech-radio/) as open-source software.
